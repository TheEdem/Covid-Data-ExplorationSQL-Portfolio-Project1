This is a data analysis project I have done to showcase my use of SQL to uncover trends and insights from the dataset.
In the project I make use of Joins, CTEs and temp tables. 

The project was done in SQL SERVER 2019.
The visualisations can be found in my tablea profile: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/etetim.edem3632/
